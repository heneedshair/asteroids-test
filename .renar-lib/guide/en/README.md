# RENAR Guide

## Why this guide

The **standard** states "what MUST be." The **guide** shows "how to do it by hand" — on your project, with your team, without halting development.

Here you will find: a 30-minute quickstart, a full end-to-end example from TZ to release, a step-by-step migration from Jira/Notion to RENAR, substrate guides (git and document store), compliance checklists, and the common pitfalls of adoption.

> Normative wording and closed lists live only in [standard/](../../standard/en/README.md). If the debate is "are we obligated to" — see the standard; if the debate is "where do I start on Monday" — you are in the right place.

## Reading order

**Newcomer:** 00 → 01 → 02 — and you can work at RENAR-1.

**Tech Lead:** 02 → 03 or 04 (by substrate) → 07 — before enabling hooks.

**PM / RTE:** 05 → 06 — when you need the link to PI and compliance.
